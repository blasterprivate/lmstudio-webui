## ideas and fixes

- Upload images for image models only

- Upload files like html css python etc...

- Store chat history in a JSON file, including all contextual information such as web searches, news, YouTube references, and other relevant data.

- Seperate older context messages(like websearch data) from newer messages to avoid overusing context length
